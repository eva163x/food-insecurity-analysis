Analyzing how food prices and local resources impact nutritional inequality in the U.S.

Data Sources:
- USDA Food Price Outlook (CPI & PPI datasets, 1974‚Äì2023)
- USDA Food Access Research Atlas (state/county food accessibility & demographics)

What We Did: 
- We explored trends in food pricing, accessibility, and socioeconomic factors to understand nutritional inequality using USDA datasets (CPI, PPI, Food Access Atlas).

Tools & Techniques:
- Data Wrangling- pandas, numpy
- Visualization- matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas
- Statistical Modeling- Linear & logistic regression (scikit-learn, scipy)

Key Insights:
- Healthy food price hikes yield higher producer profits
- Poverty and income levels correlate with food insecurity
- Geographic access to grocery stores varies by region and party lines
- Logistic model predicted SNAP-based food insecurity changes with ~68% accuracy
